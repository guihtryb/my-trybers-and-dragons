## What was proposed to develop:

- An RPG world composed of Races with unique characteristics and bestial beings without a Race but who can fight.
- It will be possible to have fight between characters and monsters and between characters.
- Some beings have energy and ability to train to the point of having an Archetype, which can be, for example, Warrior, Necromancer or Mage.
